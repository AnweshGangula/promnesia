Sometimes extension is flagged for review and you're asked to provide unminifed source code and build instructions.

To provide the source code, run: =git archive master:extension --output=promnesia-source.zip=

Also can point them at https://github.com/karlicoss/promnesia/tree/master/extension


* Building addon

To build you need Ubuntu 22.04/Jammy. The easiest way to build cleanly would be a Docker container:

#+begin_src
# run the container
docker run -it ubuntu:jammy /bin/bash

# inside the container
$ apt update && apt install -y sudo

#+end_src

After that build the addon (run these commands inside the container if you choose to do it with Docker):

#+begin_src
$ sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y git curl
$ curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_18.x | sudo -E bash -
$ sudo apt install -y nodejs
$ git clone https://github.com/karlicoss/promnesia.git
$ cd promnesia/extension/
$ npm install
$ ./build --firefox --release --lint
#+end_src

The final artifact will be in =extension/dist/artifacts/firefox/promnesia-<version>.zip=

# TODO: how to keep the instructions consistent with the CI?
