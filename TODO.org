* [2019-01-19 Sat 13:49] Switching over to communicating via private server
ok, keeping the items in memory was definitely a bad idea..
looks like the way to go is just running a server in parallel. the benefit is being able to run against the remote server, so not having to sync the links
** the database thing -- better, but still kinda clunky to update etc
** also, we could optimize easier if it's not js, presumably some users might want to store a _lot_ of links. Also more opportunity for interaction with FS and realtime watch
** also normalisation code doesn't have to be shared with JS

   

* TODO hmm, it's doing too many requests for some reason..
